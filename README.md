**📘 Project Title:**  
# **Portfolio Valuation Audit – PwC Digital Intelligence Virtual Experience**  

---

### **🎯 Project Overview**  
This project is part of the **PwC Digital Intelligence Virtual Experience**, designed to develop skills in **financial valuation, audit compliance, and cash flow forecasting**. The main objective was to determine the **fair value of a financial portfolio** as of **31 December 2020** using historical data from **June 2019 to December 2020**.  

The valuation process involved forecasting future cash flows, applying a **2.5% annual discount rate**, and calculating the present value of cash flows. The project followed **PwC's audit standards** to ensure transparency, accuracy, and compliance.

### **🚀 Key Objectives**
📊 **Data Analysis**: Calculate repayment percentages from historical data.  
📈 **Cash Flow Forecasting**: Forecast future repayments for all vintages.  
💸 **Discounting**: Apply a **2.5% annual rate** to convert forecasted cash flows into present value.  
📋 **Portfolio Valuation**: Determine the **fair value of the portfolio** as of **31 Dec 2020**.  
✅ **Audit Alignment**: Ensure the valuation aligns with the client's estimate within an acceptable threshold of **CHF 500,000**.

### **🔍 Key Methodology**
1️⃣ **Data Analysis**:  
- Extracted and cleaned data from **June 2019 to December 2020**.  
- Calculated repayment percentages for each month (vintage) relative to the origination amount.  

2️⃣ **Cash Flow Forecasting**:  
- Forecasted repayments for future periods using repayment trends from earlier periods.  
- Applied first and second-period repayment percentages to predict the future cash flow.  

3️⃣ **Discounting**:  
- Used a **2.5% annual rate** (converted to a monthly rate) to discount future cash flows.  
- Applied the present value formula:  
  \[
  PV = \text{Cash Flow} \times \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{t}}
  \]  
  Where:  
  - \( r \) = monthly discount rate  
  - \( t \) = number of months from the valuation date  

4️⃣ **Portfolio Valuation**:  
- Summed the present values of cash flows for all vintages to determine the total portfolio value.  

5️⃣ **Audit Compliance**:  
- Compared the model's valuation with the client's provided estimate.  
- Ensured the valuation difference was within the **CHF 500,000** audit threshold.
